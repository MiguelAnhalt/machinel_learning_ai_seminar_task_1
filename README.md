# machinel_learning_ai_seminar_task_1
- This repository contains the exercises from the task 1 of the subject Machine Learning and AI

# Definition of the task
- This task aims to familiarize you as students with the basics of Python and VS-Code to fullfill following tasks:
Program a first "Hello World" program with Python. Feel free to create an extended version also which combines some strings to a major string that is printed.
Program a "dice-algorithm" program with Python. Using required Python packages and confirm the randomness.
The expected result is two working Python application including a documentation and source code. The "Hello World" program is intended to show the functionality of the development environment. The “dice program” is your first program. Use standard packages and functions of Python. The dice-algorithm must prove through mathematical algorithms that the random number generator used works correctly. For example, by a diagram of the statistic distribution.
